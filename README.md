# Unity Movement Skills Project
This is a project I am using to famliarize myself with creating and/or extending [Character Controllers](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/CharacterController.html). I will transfer lessons learned here to my larger projects.

## Technologies
- Unity 2021.3 LTS in URP (Universal Render Pipeline)
- Cinemachine FreeLook Camera Package for Unity
- Polyhaven for textures

## Some Images and Preview Videos
This is the current working state of the project as of June 18, 2023 (more updates to come!)
